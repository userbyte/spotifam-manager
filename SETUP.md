# spotifam-manager setup

### you need a MongoDB server setup before you begin, so go do that if you dont have one already

## docker (recommended)

### server setup

_if you don't have docker installed yet, go install it then come back
**you also need a mongodb server!**_

**pull the [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/userbyte/sfmgr)**

```sh
docker pull userbyte/sfmgr:latest
```

**create the container**

```sh
# change these things:
#     $NAME :: desired container and volume docker name
#     $PORT :: the port you want sfmgr to be exposed on
#    $MONGO :: URI for your MongoDB instance (ex. mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017)
#   $SECRET :: some super incredibly secret string
export NAME="sfmgr" \
export PORT="..." \
export SECRET="..." \
export MONGO="..." \
docker create -p $PORT:3000 \
 --volume $NAME:/app \
 --env MONGO_URI=$MONGO \
 --env JOB_SECRET=$SECRET \
 --name $NAME \
 \ --restart always userbyte/sfmgr:latest
```

**start the container**

```sh
docker start $NAME
```

## node (lil more complicated)

### server setup

_if you don't have node, npm, and yarn installed yet, go install em then come back_

**clone this github repo**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/userbyte/sfmgr
cd sfmgr
```

**install dependencies**

```sh
yarn install # or npm install
```

**set the `MONGO_URI` and `JOB_SECRET` environment variables (required) ⚠**

_[spoooky secret generator api](https://api.stringgy.com/?length=30&amount=1&type=ALLNOSYMBOLS)_

```sh
# .env
MONGO_URI="mongodb://127."
JOB_SECRET="something_secret"
```

**build**

```sh
yarn run build # or npm run dev
```

```

# automatic jobs

**this application requires an external service to trigger its jobs**

you can set this up in a number of ways, but the easiest is probably a cron job.

there is a `run-job.sh` script included in this repo. this script simply triggers the jobs for you, and you can set them to run twice a day (recommended) via cron like this:

_important:_<br/>
_\*replace /path/to/ with actual path to dir where run-job.sh lives_<br/>
_\*set the job secret env var to the one you set earlier_

```
0 */12 * * * JOB_SECRET="..." bash /path/to/run-job.sh renewals
0 */12 * * * JOB_SECRET="..." bash /path/to/run-job.sh payments
```
